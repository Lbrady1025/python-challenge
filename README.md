CWRU Data Boot Camp Week 2 Homework

PyBank - Reads financial data from a CSV and performs an analysis on the data. The final analysis includes the total profits and losses, the average change over the period, and the months with the greatest increases and decreases. The final results are then written to a separate .txt file in the "Analysis" folder.

PyBank - Reads election data from a CSV and analyzes who the winner of the election is. The final results displayed include the total number of votes cast, the percentage and number of votes listed by candidate, and the winner of the election based on the results. The final election restults are then written into a separate txt file in the "Analysis" folder.

The CSVs used as the basis for the calculations are available in each project's respective "Resources" folder.
